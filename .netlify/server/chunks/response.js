You can read it_ [_here_](https://medium.com/psyberguide/digital-self-care-in-the-era-of-insertcrisishere-a49d661b9d11)_._\n\nWe have become accustomed to reading the latest headlines from a newsfeed.\n\nDiscussions of disaster, mass tragedy, and political scandal used to remain comfortably quarantined behind an anchor’s desk. Now, social media has outperformed traditional journalism in its influence over how we consume and share information — social, personal, political, or otherwise.\n\nNoteworthy topics of the last year ranged from controversial to inflammatory, including commentaries on mental health: the release (and subsequent Season 2 premier) of “Thirteen Reasons Why”, proposed cuts to funding for mental health care, and the emotional “stability” of the millennial generation, to name a few.\n\nMy own feeds have been especially relentless, this year, in presenting headlines of harassment, abuse, gun violence, and natural disaster. In fact, I have taken a few respite periods from my accounts when the weight of watching personal and/or national traumas unfold from behind a computer screen becomes too upsetting to maintain.\n\nOur news feeds themselves have evolved since their original inception in the early 2000’s. Now, our feeds are personalized, and programmatically curated to show us the stories that matter to us — the ones that feel personal. Social media have become incontrovertibly convenient in my own life, and I use them for reasons I consider valuable: I stay connected with old friends on Facebook, I watch real-time stories unfold on Twitter, and I document the life of my particularly photogenic dog on Instagram.\n\nThis type of technology can be great. It allows communities to mobilize and communicate around shared interests, it provides a space to share common experiences, and it can promote a sense of community.\n\nIt _also_ means that when someone in your “network” experiences a tragedy, to anyone in that network, said tragedy is **headline news**. Have you ever heard about something awful — a death, a disaster — not from the news, but from your facebook feed?\n\nNow let’s put that on a national scale. Imagine that the disaster you’re experiencing isn’t merely all over the newsfeeds of the people you’re friends with — it’s also in the print newspapers, broadcasted on national television, on the radio, and is a regular topic of discussion among peers.\n\nI use a variety of social platforms for both personal and professional reasons. I try to keep up with current events, and remain aware of the social climate that I inhabit from day-to-day; in fact, staying aware is extremely important to me.\n\nBut managing the influx of emotional and poignant news can be overwhelming. Close friends of mine have chosen to disconnect entirely from social media, and I empathize deeply with their reasons for doing so. For me, completely “unplugging” would create a different set of personal and professional obstacles, making it an unrealistic long-term solution.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time discussing — both professionally, and among friends — how to navigate the delicate balance of benefits and hindrances that social media can provide.\n\nIts 2018 now, and the troublesome headlines of last year show no sign of slowing down. Chances are that you, or someone you love, has been personally affected by at least one conversation on the national hashtag stage.\n\nIn 2011, MIT’s Sherry Turkle published a landmark book on the impact of social media on society and communication titled “Alone Together”; if you’ve spent any time at all watching home-hitting hashtags (e.g. #MeToo, #BelieveWomen, #WhyIStayed, #PrayForOrlando) make tidal waves across the internet, you are probably as familiar as I am with what she means.\n\nAs the web continues to expand and evolve, there will never be one “right way” to practice self-care on the internet. But however you choose to engage (or not) with the era of #InsertCrisisHere, a few important points still bear repeating.\n\n1. **Follow the Airplane Rule — “Put your own oxygen mask on first”.** Everyone needs help sometimes — including you. It can be powerful to reach out to other survivors, participate in protests, and make your story and voice heard; it is _equally_ important to take care of yourself too.\n2. **Choose your words carefully.** When you talk about the outcome of a tragedy, or the actions of a perpetrator you are also describing the experience of a survivor. Be mindful of _how_ you describe a disaster, an assailant, or an affected community. Chances are, those survivors are on the internet too.\n3. **Trauma is an experience, not an event; your experience — no matter what it is — is valid.** You may find yourself feeling anxious, scared, or ashamed. You may experience guilt over your own contributions — or lack thereof — to conversations that affect you. You may find yourself feeling “unworthy” of experiencing distress because “other people have it worse”.\n4. You do not owe your story to anyone.\n   You do not owe your comment to anyone.\n   And **you are NOT alone.**\n\nIf you or someone you love is in crisis, please call 9–1–1 or go to the nearest emergency room.\n\nNational Sexual Assault Hotline: 1–800–656–4673\nSAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline: 1–800–985–5990\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1–800–273-TALK (8255)\n';

The concept of a virtual doctor seems novel — versions of the idea have [disappointed](https://www.fastcompany.com/90318752/doctors-are-using-hospital-robots-to-tell-patients-theyre-dying-sparking-an-outcry) patients and clinicians alike.\n\nThe practice of making a computer respond like a doctor _is_ a bad idea, but it is not a new idea — it spans decades. Long before there was Siri, or Alexa, there was DOCTOR ELIZA — it’s creator specifically warned us not to do this.\n\nIn 1966, scientists at MIT developed a set of computational rules they called “Natural Language Processing” — aptly named, the algorithm allowed a computer to parse natural language into meaningful elements. Today, when I type “where is the closest Chipotle?” into a search engine, the results I receive are not documents with the phrase “where is closest Chipotle?” — it returns a list of actual Chipotle locations near me*.* This translation between my search terms, and the results I receive, is Natural Language Processing at work.\n\nThis is the same technology we see in chatbots today, and it is indeed, deceptively simple:\n\nA user inputs a statement. The computer inspects that statement for a specific keyword or phrase. When the word or phrase is found, the computer finds a “rule” associated with the keyword, and uses the rule to generate a response. 1\n\nMIT’s Joseph Weizenbaum was the first to build natural language processing capabilities inside a computer, a chatbot program he called ELIZA. Weizenbaum himself regarded ELIZA as parody of human-computer interaction; by his own admission, ELIZA represented the _limited_ potential of “man-to-machine” intelligence. He wrote of his concern over his colleagues tendencies to infer emotional assessments of ELIZA after ‘conversing’ with the program, despite its lack of processing or comprehension capabilities.\n\nAs a demonstration of the artificial “closeness” that ELIZA could generate, he created a version of the software with a modified rule: the DOCTOR rule.\n\nA user inputs a statement. The computer inspects that statement for the general meaning, rephrases it, and reflects the statement back to the user, or a question related to the sentiment, if one can be found.\n\nUpon the publication of his ELIZA work, Weizenbaum wrote:\n\n> “[…] machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked […] its magic crumbles away. The object of this paper is to cause just such a reevaluation […] Few programs ever needed it more.”\n\nToday, ELIZA is best known for these mannerisms that mimic verbiage of a psychotherapist. The concept has been reincarnated in various forms in the decades since, including the creation of therapeutic chat-bots for your smartphone, like Youper, Wysa, and Reflectly.\n\nResearchers have warned that the digital age has left us more prone to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression3; they’ve also shown that digital tools can help us feel more connected to people we love4, and can sometimes provide useful tools to improve our mental health5 .\n\nThe tech leaders of Silicon Valley have become [infamous for their motto “Move Fast and Break Things”](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-silicon-valley-move-fast-and-break-things/) —a saying that has not aged well amidst lawsuits, privacy scandals, and other public missteps. The science on the potential harm of chat-bots is limited, but we know that feeling ‘misunderstood’ by a technology can have a direct and immediate effect on our basic needs and sense of belonging6.\n\nOne fact is undeniable — technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. But perhaps, we should heed the advice of those who built these tools, andmove more slowly.\n\nAnd try _not_ to break anything.\n\n## References\n\n1. Weizenbaum, J. (1966).

The Dot-Com boom of the 1990’s delivered unprecedented access to a global network of information, and with it, an unprecedented blow to the Silicon Valley start-ups that had become profitable by monetizing web-based technologies.\n\nAt its inception, Google promised an ad-free search engine, and was not shy about the data they were saving from search queries. The Google Headquarters [famously featured a monitor](https://trip101.com/article/visiting-google) that listed real-time searches from users around the world. But faced with the corporate identity crisis of the World Wide Web, Google analysts discovered that the years of stored search histories, when combined with the computational power of the Google servers, could _predict_ a piece of future human behavior — where was someone likely to click.\n\nTraditional advertising, until that point, involved deploying a message on a billboard or banner-ad, and hoping that it made its way to the right people. Google, instead, could now package and sell their black-box computational software as a product that can predict this one small, but significant piece of human behavior.\n\nAs we have become increasingly reliant on the internet for day-to-day life, our online “clicks” have become increasingly associated with our offline activities. Today, the most powerful tech companies have built their empires on the sale of black-box analytic products that deliver a mathematical certainty of what each user is likely to do now, soon and in the future; this kind of _Information Capitalism_ relies heavily on users to offer their data without a full awareness of how predictive spurious pieces of information can be — particularly when funneled through the black-boxes layered beneath corporate hard-drives; for instance, consider the 2012 case of a father who was alerted to his teenage daughter’s pregnancy [vis-a-vis Target’s advertising platform that mailed congratulatory prenatal coupons to their home](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#2b9cd2d66668), based on the daughters’ browsing and purchase history.\n\nThe last year, in particular, has sparked legitimate questions about standards for privacy within these companies. [Facebook](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/08/ftc-approves-final-settlement-facebook) and [Uber](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/04/uber-agrees-expanded-settlement-ftc-related-privacy-security) have settled multiple cases with the Federal Trading Commission for their mismanagement of user data; corporate giants in every major US industry were affected by data breaches in 2018, including (but not limited to) Google+, LinkedIn, [Verizon Wireless](https://www.upguard.com/breaches/verizon-cloud-leak), [British Airways](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2018/09/20/how-the-british-airways-breach-will-reveal-the-true-cost-of-gdpr/#4c5f00853edf), [TicketMaster](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ticketmaster-data-breach-monzo-inbenta), and [Marriott Hotels.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2018/11/30/marriott-breach-what-happened-how-serious-is-it-and-who-is-impacted/#7311e7127d25)\n\nPerhaps the most notorious of recent examples was that of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, after reports surfaced that 87 million Facebook Users’ data had been used in an alleged attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSuch scandals are often described as “data breaches”. It’s easy to assume that the term “breach” refers to a bug in a product’s security software, or some other hacker-driven malfeasance. In reality, such events result from some combination of misunderstanding, and the strategic use of fine-print in user agreements.\n\nIndeed, the mathematical certainty of changing of users’ behavior, in an election or elsewhere, is the primary currency of Silicon Valley. This particular scandal may never have risen to public attention, had the data not been used by a political consulting firm, amidst a tumultuous election, while still employing a whistleblower willing to speak out in this particular use case.\n\nThis behavioral currency we provide in the form of searches and likes — or, as author Shoshanna Zuboff describes it in her book of the same name “Surveillance Capitalism” — relies on _our_ data. US legislators have only recently begun to consider regulating the industry, and efforts by the UK have received significant pushback by tech companies in the United States.\n\nYou can educate more about how to identify the apps and websites with which you’ve shared your information and how to disable it where you’d like — In [Tech Tips: Find your Facebook Data](https://psyberguide.org/resources/tech-tips-facebook-data/), and [Tech Tips: Find your Google Data](https://psyberguide.org/resources/tech-tips-find-and-manage-your-google-data/), [PsyberGuide](http://PsyberGuide.org) provides a quick 2-3 step guide to find and control the personal data that you’ve shared on each platform.\n';

## Background
The expanding amount of information available from our use of technologies has led researchers to explore how this information can aid in the detection of mental health issues. We expand on past work in this area by exploring how browsing histories might be able to predict perceived barriers to psychological treatment.
## Methods
We obtained 10 days of browsing history data for 255 respondents as well as assessments of Perceived Barriers to Psychological Treatments and depression, the Patient Health Questionnaire.
## Results
We found that browsing histories enabled high performance classification of people with high levels of perceived barriers to psychological treatments (AUC average of 0.86).
## Limitations
Our high classification accuracy does not help understand why different features within the browsing histories are useful to classify people according to browsing history. We also look at people who decided to contribute their browsing history but the use of this data more generally presents additional ethical questions.
## Conclusions
Browsing histories might be useful to classify people's barriers to seeking psychological treatment. It is clinically relevant to find those who perceive barriers to seeking treatment to better design ways to address those concerns and help them find treatment.`;

Our first study involved 400 study participants categorized as Healthy Controls (HC), Psychiatric Controls (PC) and as having IED and included the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (SDS), the Lie Scale from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R Lie), and the Readiness to Change (Anger) Questionnaire (RTC). IED study participants had lower SDS and lower EPQ-R Lie scores, while having higher RTC scores, compared with both HC and PC study participants. Thus, when studied in a clinical research setting, IED study participants do not provide socially desirable answers to questions and do not engaging in deceptive reporting; likely because they have recognized their need/interest in reducing their own impulsive aggressive behavior. The second study, part of a family study of 70 probands and their first-degree relatives revealed a very high positive (96.3%), but substantially lower negative (55.8%), predictive power for IED based on informant report. This suggests that, while interview of close informants can confirm the diagnosis of IED, informant interviews cannot rule out IED when such informants provide a negative report.';

Mood is one of the individual differences that researchers have investigated with regard to false memories creation (e.g. Storbeck & Clore, 2005, 2011). While previous literature suggests that negative mood improves memory accuracy, this has only been tested on neutral stimuli. The current study investigated the relation between memory accuracy of negative stimuli versus neutral stimuli, and the connection to negative affect, cognitive style, and depression. Data suggest a small but significant positive relation between depression and false negative memory creation (r=.201, p<.02). Further factor analyses reveled separate components of depression that, are more tied to false negative memories than others. Specifically, the cognitive components of depression (i.e. feelings of worthlessness, self-criticism, crying, indecisiveness, self-dislike, sadness, and guilt) were the most predictive of negative false memories (r=.201, p<.02).';
