The study of false memories has been of particular interest to cognitive psychologists in the past few decades (Gallo, 2010). Mood is one of the individual differences that researchers have investigated with regard to false memories creation (e.g. Storbeck & Clore, 2005, 2011). While previous literature suggests that negative mood improves memory accuracy, this has only been tested on neutral stimuli. The current study investigated the relation between memory accuracy of negative stimuli versus neutral stimuli, and the connection to negative affect, cognitive style, and depression. Data suggest a small but significant positive relation between depression and false negative memory creation (r=.201, p<.02). Further factor analyses reveled separate components of depression that, are more tied to false negative memories than others. Specifically, the cognitive components of depression (i.e. feelings of worthlessness, self-criticism, crying, indecisiveness, self-dislike, sadness, and guilt) were the most predictive of negative false memories (r=.201, p<.02).
