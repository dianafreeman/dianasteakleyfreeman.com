A whimsical set of self-care related illustrations based on my dog, Rafiki used as part of a mental wellness social media campaign for [One Mind PsyberGuide, the Mental Health App Guide](https://onemindpsyberguide.org/), in 2019.

<img src="/images/rafiki-to-the-rescue/benice.jpeg" alt="A cartoon-style Yorkshire Terrier sits on the bottom-left quarter of the image. He has a red collar with a yellow charm,  his tongue is hanging out and his head is cocked slightly to the left. The rest of the image is covered in messily-written text that says 'Will you be nice to yourself today? I would come snuggle with you on the couch and listen to everything you are feeling, but I have little paws, and it would take me too long to walk there. So be nice to yourself for me, okay?' Rafiki (a paw print is next to his name) " />

alt="a cartoon yorkshire terrier on the bottom-right quarter of the image is pulling a rope across the page on a dark blue background. The messy handwriting above the cartoon dog reads 'it's okay if you're hurting right now. You'll pull through this, too. - Rafiki (a paw print is next to his name) "
