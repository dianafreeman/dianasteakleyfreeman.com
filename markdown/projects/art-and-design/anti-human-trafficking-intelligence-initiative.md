In 2019, I was contracted to create and implement a branding and design overhaul for the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative.

<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid white; padding: 1em; margin: 1rem;">
The AHTII aims to help financial institutions promote corporate social responsibility through increasing awareness, facilitating intelligence integration & technology advancement, and encouraging strategic data collaboration - to combat human trafficking.
