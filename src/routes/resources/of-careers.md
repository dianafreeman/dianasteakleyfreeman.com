What if....

...what if we leveraged technology to drive people *out* of their echo-chambers, and *into* their communities to create real change?

What if, instead of dragging users into the depths of a doom-scroll, we built innovative and creative experiences that steer them towards genuine change-making?


The Product and Technology Team at The Obama Foundation brings together software engineers, experience designers, systems thinkers, product leaders, data analysts, and content strategists from a variety of backgrounds together to do exactly that.

We’re building technologies to power The Obama Presidential Center, as well as a global pipeline of change-makers, community organizers, and everyday people; we’re on a mission of civic storytelling, guiding people in their journey from Hope to Action.

Oh, and yes,
we are [#hiring](https://www.obama.org/careers).
