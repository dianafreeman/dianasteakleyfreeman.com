# Card
Lets get specific;

## The problem:
The shadows on white cards show up behind all of teh cards.

They should be visible whenever a card is active, no matter the display type or order.

Option 1:
    - does changing to display-flex fix this?

Option 2:
    - can I create a full content wrapper that shows a rectantular shadow (svg generated?) on hover?

## ToDo:
-- rearrange this shadow box method
-- There are too many components here
