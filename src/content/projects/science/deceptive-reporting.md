## Abstract
Individuals with DSM-5 Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) are often suspected of minimizing the nature of their recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior due to the social undesirability of these behaviors. Our first study involved 400 study participants categorized as Healthy Controls (HC), Psychiatric Controls (PC) and as having IED and included the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (SDS), the Lie Scale from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R Lie), and the Readiness to Change (Anger) Questionnaire (RTC). IED study participants had lower SDS and lower EPQ-R Lie scores, while having higher RTC scores, compared with both HC and PC study participants. Thus, when studied in a clinical research setting, IED study participants do not provide socially desirable answers to questions and do not engaging in deceptive reporting; likely because they have recognized their need/interest in reducing their own impulsive aggressive behavior. The second study, part of a family study of 70 probands and their first-degree relatives revealed a very high positive (96.3%), but substantially lower negative (55.8%), predictive power for IED based on informant report. This suggests that, while interview of close informants can confirm the diagnosis of IED, informant interviews cannot rule out IED when such informants provide a negative report.
