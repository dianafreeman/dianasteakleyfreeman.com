Apparently I’m a particular **kind** of black.
Not a threatening kind,
Not an angry kind,
The kind that’s not black enough to scare you
light enough to make your whiteness feel not-totally-unknown.

I guess my “proper-speaking”, pants-above-my-hips kind of black,
makes the white people who love me comfortable sharing their “thoughts” on all of this.

The white people who love me, trust me enough to ask me how to help.
So when I say “I don’t know, sorry”
they are insulted, because they thought I was a friendly, approachable, intellectually curious kind of black.

White allies who love me, share photos of dead black bodies under white badged knees because
ain’t the behavior of this badged knee shocking??

And black people said,  “No. But thank you for your attention”

And under the backdrop of the national guard, broken windows, and shattered glass sidewalks, White people who love me “double check” with me to make sure I still don’t personally condone violence — that I am “intelligent” enough to know where to draw the line.

As if drawing one at all does not fill in the answer you’re looking for.

White people who love me ask me “if they are one of the good ones”.
And I say “that you are asking this question is not exceptionally promising”

And they are hurt.
They regret having brought it up in the first place
Actually Diana, I think you might not be the right person for me to talk through this with.

Because there is that line again. The one you’ve penciled in with the answer you’re looking for.

So when the white people — women, queer people — who love me,  ask “I get the protesting, but why does it need to be violent? It stresses everyone out and doesn’t accomplish anything”...

the white people who love me, trust me to be the kind of black women that does not get angry.

So I don’t know what to say.

“White women can vote because in 1910 the suffragettes got pissed and they rioted”?
“Martin Luther King -- before he was assassinated for doing so and his history white washed -- rioted”

That “the first Pride Parade started when the first brick was thrown at stonewall”

That “when you say “violence doesn’t solve anything” and you know about this history, what you’re really saying is this particular issue does not call-for a riot. At least, not yet.”

How many of your children would need to be murdered by police live, on camera, for you to start to feel justified in burning the station down?

And.

I know.

This **IS** hard.
It **IS** painful.

It is hard to be told that the color of your skin has a direct impact on the value you can add to a conversation.

It is hard to be asked not to speak, to listen, only, and go do some work on your own to catch up in the areas you

This icky feeling you’re having -- black folks know this feeling.
We've felt it our whole lives.

We know that it is hard when you _WANT_ to speak —
you have a point to make;
maybe you even have a carefully considered analysis to offer.

But at some point, the person you’re explaining your feelings to might dismiss you. They might consider your words empty -- despite your good intentions, your education, your  experience, your qualifcations to discuss the mater,

simply because of the color of your skin.

And that? That **is** hard.

Isn’t it.
